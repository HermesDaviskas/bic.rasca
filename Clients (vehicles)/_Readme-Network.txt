Raspberry is configure to automatically connect to 

SSID: AwacsNet
PASS: NaN@1234
DHCP: 192.168.20.xxx(151, 152, ...)
if the wifi is ON.

If AwacsNet is not broadcasting it will automatically try to connect to
SSID: raspiconfig
DHCP: Auto
which is open.

Creating a hotspot with this SSID, will allow raspi to have Internet access.
